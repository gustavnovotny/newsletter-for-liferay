Info
==============================================================
Blue Newsletter is a showcase of rapidly developed (less than two days of work), enterprise-friendly Vaadin portlet for
Liferay Portal. Persistence has been provided by the Hibernate Framework.

Tutorial providing more implementation details and screenshots is available at
http://www.bluesoft.net.pl/rnd/blog

The application delivers three independent portlets:
 * newsletter subscription portlet - available to all users (of course depending on portlet instance configuration)
 * newsletter sending portlet - used by content managers
 * newsletter admin portlet - allowing admin users to define new newsletters

The dependency on pl.net.bluesoft.util maven package can be resolved by obtaining and building https://github.com/tlipski/BlueSoft-Util.

The application has been deployed and tested on liferay-portal-6.0.6 running on top of tomcat-6.0.29. Vaadin version has been upgraded to 6.5.4 due to a problem with RichTextArea for Vaadin 6.4.10 provided initially with Liferay 6.0.6.

Roadmap
==============================================================
First of all, tests under different browsers/liferay configurations should be performed.

The following features would be highly desired:
 * List subscribed users inside admin portlet
 * Management of subscribed users inside admin portlet/other portlet, including subscription for Liferay Users, Roles, Organizations etc.
 * Multithreaded sending mechanism (e.g. JMS-based)
 * Sent newsletters history and status (newsletter console)

Then, features suggested at http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Proposals/Newsletter+Portlet should be considered.
